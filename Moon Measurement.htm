<h1 title='You read that right'>Moon Measurement</h1>

<p>In March 2025, a lunar eclipse occurred, visible from most of America. I had just finished building my homemade refracting telescope at that time.<br>
Doing the logical thing, I hosted a spontaneous mini <del>star</del> lunar party in the yard of the university housing. <br>
About 10-20 people came and took a whole lot of pictures using my telescope, some having better <br>
quality than others. A thought passed my mind, what if, using these high-quality pictures, I compare them to other pictures taken from, say, Mexico,<br>
and use that to measure the distance from the Earth to the Moon!</p>
<br>
<p>This was the image taken by my friend (Leon)'s phone that morning, at totality, 3:00 a.m. </p>

<p>And this was the image taken by a Seattle-based astrophotographer by the name of Roger Barnett I had found through Facebook, at 2:58 a.m.</p>

<br>
<p>I then used the visible stars HIP 56388 and HIP 56376 on the right side of the image to align the image, since the parallax of background stars compared <br>
to the moon would be very, very small. This next image is me using Canvas to layer it on top of one another</p>

<p>Finally, using a software I used to edit fantasy maps I larped with, paint.net, I counted the parallax angel in pixels, it came to about 330.13 pixels, which can <br>
be seen with the apparent size of the moon above.</p>
<p>I hadn't mentioned the eyepiece I used, but it was a 30mm Ploessl, resulting in a 20 times magnification with my 600mm refractor, with 50 degrees AFOV, <br>
meaning the TFOV would be 50/20 = 2.5 degrees</p>
<p>I took this value and counted the diameter of theentire FOV of my picture, which was 1727 pixels. Meaning the degree/pixel value is 2.5/1727 = 0.001447596989</p>
<p>Now, we use trigonometry and the distance (through the Earth) between Toronto and Seattle. It is roughly 1592.03160852 km halfway there, using the Google Earth feature<br>
to measure the surface distance between my observing spot and the middle of the city, and then employing a bit of trigonometry before dividing it by two. <br>
We just need to plug these values into the formula: distance to the moon = distance of cities/tan(0.5*parallax angle)</p>
<p>Of course, we still need to calculate the actual parallax angle which is: 0.001447596989*330.13 =  0.477895193979 degrees</p>
<p>Now the distance = 1592.03160852 km/tan(0.5* 0.477895193979) =  381,741.3 km!! Which was only a 4.35% error since the actual distance at the time was 399,100 km</p>
<p>While the distance is actually the distance from the moon to the chord that exists between Toronto and Seattle, but, considering the large numbers we are <br>
dealing with, it shouldn't be too far off from the actual value, whether or not the cities are farther or closer.</p>
